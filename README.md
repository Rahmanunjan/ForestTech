# ForestTech

INTRODUCTION

This is a project aiming to reduce Carbon emissions by planting trees and tokensing ownership of the trees with a soulbound NFT. An escrow would allow Sponsors, Investors and individuals to contribute to an Escrow and receive the ForesTech token (an ERC20) in exchange. The Soulbound Token would serve as certification for Carbon emission reduction participation. Individuals will join a DAO and it will decide where Trees should be planted. Additionally, a governance Token will be used to vote for Planting Areas. Long term, a vesting smart contract will be used to release token represenetation of selected planting areas.
